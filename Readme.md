This library provides a utility method for checking whether an input string conforms to
spesific rules. In particular, it checks:
 - whether string length is within specified boudaries;
 - whether it contains at least one lowercase character;
 - whether it contains at least one uppercase character;
 - whether it contains at least one digit character;
 - whether it contains at least one special character (!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{{|}}~.);
 - whether it does not contain any whitespace characters.
